Acting as a software engineer who is detail orientated, read the current code base and compare the TestAPEN FSD. Create a differences doc based on the FSD to reflect the current state of the code and the FSD. The Differences doc should show all the changes that would be needed to the FSD toupdate it in such a way as to ensure that if you were to use the FSD you could then create the same features, processes, workflows and effectively the same code (not exactly the same, but code that has the same intent and process). Make sure to version the differences doc so that we know if we are working on the latest version or not, and when working on the differences doc, include the version of FSD that is being used for comparison.
